# get-ticket
A super simple chrome extension that copies the JIRA number and name into the clipboard so you can use it to create a branch.

This was created since Arc Browser does not support bookmarklets, which we used earlier. 

To import this extension into Arc:
- cmd-L -> Manage extensions
- Click Developer mode
- Load unpacked
- Choose the folder
- Boom, it is there

To use it:
- Click the extension icon
- Boom, it is copied into the clipboard
